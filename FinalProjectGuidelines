In this repository, there are a few examples of final project proposals from FE 550 in previous years.  
These should serve as a starting point for how you should fashion your final project proposals. 
You will notice that many are narrative heavy, which is not a strict requirement, though you should 
be able to present a solid understanding of the work you are undertaking.  

What I expect, at a minimum, are the following:

-A brief narrative description (200-300 words)
-Research questions that you are seeking to answer
-Data Sources
-Ideas/Examples 
-Visualization Type or types
-Technology (for Visualization, Refinement)

You should choose a topic that holds value to you, as you will be spending a fair amount of time in the coming weeks 
putting your project together. You should also focus on what is implicit in the data with which you are working.  
That is, the conclusions to your questions should not be obvious, and your visualization choice should assist 
in providing answers.  I might also suggest that you allocate some time into honing your presentation skills, 
as it should not be the role of the audience to extricate details for each of the requirements listed above.
